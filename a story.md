A new criminal had arrived at the prison entrance. His shirt was ragged and torn; he had gashes on his arms and legs; his hair was unkempt and he hung his head low, wrists cuffed.
With a yank, my colleague, like a dog, led him to me. As a prison guard (warden), I had to face prisoners regularly and I was already used to it by now. However, my heart still
aches whenever I have to witness someone in such a state. My colleague handed the prisoner’s ‘leash’ to me to bring this prisoner to his designated cell. Two prison guards were
commanded to tail behind us in case this criminal resorted to violence. Just then, the prisoner lifted his head slightly. Our eyes met. I was stunned. Isn’t he the tough guy who
used to bully and taunt me back in our school days? The same angry shots his eyes gave, the same ruffled hair dyed red, and I instantly realised that his facial features had not
changed much either the closer I looked. He scrutinised my face simultaneously and I had an uneasy feeling that he could recognise me too. The anger in his eyes turned to
mischief.
Then, he burst into laughter,saying, "Oh what do we have here?I see your aspirations of becoming an astronaut has come true,huh?"Then, he burst into another round of laughter.I
rolled my eyes and mocked him,"And what have you become,professional weightlifter?""Oh",he said,"I got tired of lifting weights,so I decided to lift shops and I recently lifted 
that 12 carat diamond next door, I doubt you could even touch that."I laughed and my mind wandered off to a better time, both for me and for him.The memories of all the wacky
moments we had in class,the way he always helped me in math (which predicted the reason I could not be an astronaut,apparently, math is important", and that time we executed the 
great "heist" of Dunman.Then, my chief prodded me in my chest, waking me from the good signs.
